# Touch-Free Museum Quiz Exhibit

This exhibit was inspired by the circumstances presented during the COVID-19 global pandemic and was created by me, Joseph Manfredi Cameron, for an assignment in the Interactive Software & Hardware (CS5041) module at the University of St Andrews.

## Abstract
This projectâ€™s aim was to create a museum exhibit where visitors can participate in and interact with a multiple-choice quiz without having to touch anything.
Visitors can achieve this solely by showing their hands to a camera to answer questions and by hovering their hands over a photoresistor sensor to perform confirmation actions.
The main motivation for creating this exhibit to be touch-free and to not require any contact with buttons or the like was to develop a museum exhibit that can reduce the potential for contamination spread.
The need for this type of exhibit in busy public settings such as museums has been highlighted by the COVID-19 global pandemic where it is necessary to limit the spread of the virus.
This exhibit was developed using the [p5.js JavaScript software library](https://p5js.org) and the [Arduino Uno microcontroller](https://www.arduino.cc).
The software developed in p5.js acts as both an input and an output for the exhibit, where a screen displays the quiz screen as an output, and a camera collects images from which the software can detect the number of fingers a visitor is holding up.
Similarly, the hardware controlled by the Arduino also serve as inputs and outputs of the exhibit.
