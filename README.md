# TouchFreeQuizExhibit
This project demonstrates a museum exhibit where visitors can participate in and interact with a multiple-choice quiz without touching anything. This exhibit was inspired by the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and was created by me for an assignment in the Interactive Software &amp; Hardware (CS5041) module at the University of St Andrews.
